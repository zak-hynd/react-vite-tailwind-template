# Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to be somewhat of a "portfolio" thing. A way to showcase some of the projects I've worked on. If I have been even mildly competent with it, it ought to speak for itself.

# Tech
As for the tech in this repo, I spent far too long trying to wrangle my previous html+css personal/user github pages into a React + Typescript + Tailwind + Vite setup. In the end, I figured it would be easier to grab someone else's template that was specifically configured for GitHub Pages - so I forked [doragrishaeva's template](https://github.com/doragrishaeva/react-vite-tailwind-template).

It still took me several hours to get _that_ working as my "user page", which seems to work a bit differently to other GitHub pages.

I've since mangled it - trying to structure the repo into something a bit more similar to what we were taught in Dev Academy Aotearoa's Bootcamp course.
